# FYP---Face-Recognition-Based-Smart-Solution-for-Students-Security.

# Introduction:

The title mentioned describe our final year project. Face Recognition Based Smart Solution for student security ensure student security. To achieve student’s security, we have developed a security system that is based on face recognition. Other biometric techniques are also available like fingerprints, voice recognition, RFID systems etc. However, these technologies may lead to proxies and unauthorized access. As we know that the primary identification of human is faces so face recognition is a secure and a unique technique to ensure student security. <br />
This automated system will be able to recognize student and send an alert message to the student guardian that student is present and safe. If the student face is not recognized by the system, then the system will send an alert message to the student guardian that the student is absent. The system will also be able to generate an excel sheet for every class including student’s attendance.

# Project Objective:

*	To ensure student’s security <br />
*	To provide rapid feedback to student’s parent <br />
*	To provide an automated process for student’s attendance <br />
*	To save time that may spend on attendance <br />
*	To eliminate unauthorized access <br />
